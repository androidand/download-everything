Sure, here's an example README.md file:

Download Everything
===================

This script downloads all .zip files from a given URL and verifies their integrity.

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.x
*   tqdm

Usage
-----

1.  Install tqdm: `pip install tqdm`
2.  Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/download-everything.git`
3.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the downloaded repository: `cd download-everything`
4.  Run the script: `python download.py`

The script will prompt you to enter the URL from which you want to download the .zip files. Once you enter the URL, the script will start downloading the .zip files and verifying their integrity.

The downloaded files will be saved in the same directory as the script. If a file with the same name already exists in the directory, the script will skip the download and verify the integrity of the existing file.
